"This course will cover different uses of SQL but will focus on data analysis.

SQL is used in virtually every industry so get read to superpower your skillset."

### Parch & Posey Database
In this course we wil be using the Parch & Posey Database for our queries.

"Parch & Posey (not a real company) is a paper company and the database includes sales data for their paper." 

we will be performing some real world problem solving using the sales data from this database


## Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)

As specified in the classroom, it is the common way to view data in a database.

<img title="an ERD table" alt="ERD table" src="./ERD_table.png">

above is the Entity Relationship Database for parch and Porsey Database.
There are 5 tables in the database:
1. web_events
2. accounts
3. orders
4. sales_reps
5. region

"The "crow's foot" that connects the tables together shows us how the columns in one table relate to the columns in another table."

In the first lesson, i learned the basics of how to work with SQL to interact with a single table. In the next lesson, I will be learning more about why these connections are so important for working with SQL and relational databases.
