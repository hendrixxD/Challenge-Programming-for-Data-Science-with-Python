# Introduction to Logical Operators

In the next concepts, you will be learning about Logical Operators. Logical Operators include:

    ```LIKE``` This allows you to perform operations similar to using ```WHERE``` and ```=```, but for cases when you might not know exactly what you are looking for.

    ```IN``` This allows you to perform operations similar to using ```WHERE``` and ```=```, but for more than one condition.

    ```NOT``` This is used with ```IN``` and ```LIKE``` to select all of the rows ```NOT LIKE``` or ```NOT IN``` a certain condition.

    ```AND & BETWEEN``` These allow you to combine operations where all combined conditions must be true.

    ```OR``` This allows you to combine operations where at least one of the combined conditions must be true.
